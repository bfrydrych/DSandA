Imagine a 2d matrix of dimensions mxn. Every cell of this matrix has x,y coordinates (0 <= x < m, 0 <= y, n).

The matrix represents a lion-infested savannah.

There’s a person somewhere in the matrix at coordinates X0, Y0. They want to reach their car at coordinates X1, Y1.

But there are also a number of sleeping lions at coordinates xi, yi. There’s also a distance D whereby if somebody gets within a D radius of a sleeping lion, they would wake up the lion.

Given all of these coordinates and the distance D, return the the fastest route between the person and their car that doesn’t wake a lion, or null if there is no such path.
